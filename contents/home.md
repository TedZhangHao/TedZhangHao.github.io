### About me 🙌
Hi there 👋! My name is **Hao Zhang (张昊)**. I am currently pursuing my Master's Degree in **[Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/)** at **Johns Hopkins University (JHU)**, where I also work at Center for Language and Speech Processing ([CLSP](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/)) under the supervision by [Prof. Laureano Moro-Velazquez](https://pages.jh.edu/lmorove1/index.html). Before coming to JHU, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in **Intelligent Medical Engineering** at Shandong University. During that time, I worked as a **research assistant** in Key Laboratory of Machine Intelligence & System Control, Ministry of Education, where I focused on **deep learnning-based time series analysis** and **few-shot learning**, supervised by [Prof. Teng Li](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liteng123/zh_CN/index.htm).  

My current research interests focus on **SpeechLLMs Naturalness** and **LLM-enhanced data augmentation for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA)**. I am conducting independent research on these areas and with excitement to discuss and collaborate. Please feel free to contact me!
